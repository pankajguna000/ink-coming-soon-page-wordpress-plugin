== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will the page work with my existing theme? =

Yes, this is a plugin and will work with your existing theme.

= I'm not able to see the Coming Soon  page! =

As long as you're logged in, you won't be able to see it. That's a feature! This way, while you're logged in you can work as usual. To preview what it looks like, either a) log out, or b) try viewing it in another browser

= I'm finished with it, and disabled the plugin, but the "Coming Soon" message is still showing up! =

If you have disabled the plugin, it won't show anything anymore. Usually, though, the issue is that you're seeing a cached version of the page. Try force-refreshing your browser, and then try clearing your cache on the server and force refreshing again.
